      <h4>His [Former] Pimpness</h4>
      <p>
        $ attended Wolf Swamp Road Elementary School. While there, he led the black team to 3 Field Day Championships in 4 years. He went on to attend Glenbrook Middle School, always sporting a sick bike and hanging out at Friendly's after school. He continued his education at public high school LHS, where he ran shit. He especially dominated East Longmeadow shmoes and Cathedral hoes. In 2004, he even graduated. Following his public school education, $ did nothing. His skills became useless with age, and he slowly disappeared into oblivion. He has been officially deemed "missing" for the last 8 years.
