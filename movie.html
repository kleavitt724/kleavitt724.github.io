  <h2>Summary</h2>
  
  <p>
    Mitchell Goosen is sixteen/seventeen year old kid from California who loves to surf and roller blade. Yet, his parents, who are two zoologists were given a grant to work in Australia. The only problem was: Mitchell couldn't go with them. So, he gets sent to stay with his aunt, uncle, and cousin in Cincinnati, Ohio. When he arrives, he meets his cousin who is also his new roommate for the next six months: Wiley. Mitchell then goes to school and gets on the bad side the high school hockey players. Mitchell and Wiley end up enduring weeks of torture from the guys. Then, the big guys and Mitchell and Wiley have to learn to get along to try to beat the Central High School rivals in a competition down Devil's Backbone.

  <h3>Roger Ebert says...</h3>
  <p>Director Dominic Burns really nailed this one. The characters have tremendous depth--by the end of the movie I feel like I've known Mitchel Goosen my whole life. Just another display of Burns' mastery.</p>
